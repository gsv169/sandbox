## Interactive Graphic Novel Web Application - Implementation Plan

This plan outlines the development of a web application that allows users to experience a graphic novel with interactive dialogue choices, creating a "graphic novel game" experience.

### 1. Technology Stack

*   **Frontend:** React (JavaScript library for building user interfaces)
*   **Styling:** Bootstrap CSS (for responsive and modern UI components)

### 2. Core Features

*   **Scene Display:** A central area to display the current graphic novel panel (image) and any associated narrative text.
*   **Interactive Dialogue Choices:**
    *   When a scene presents choices, these will be rendered as clickable buttons.
    *   Clicking a dialogue choice will dynamically update the displayed scene, leading the user down a specific narrative path.
*   **State Management:** The application will manage the current scene's state to ensure correct progression through the story based on user choices.

### 3. Data Structure

A simple JSON structure will be defined to represent the graphic novel's scenes and their branching logic. Each scene object will include:

*   `id`: A unique identifier for the scene.
*   `image`: The path to the graphic novel panel image for the scene.
*   `text` (Optional): Narrative or descriptive text associated with the scene.
*   `choices` (Optional): An array of choice objects. Each choice object will contain:
    *   `text`: The text displayed for the choice button.
    *   `nextSceneId`: The `id` of the scene to transition to if this choice is selected.

### 4. Design and User Experience (UX)

*   **Clean and Minimalist:** The design will prioritize the graphic novel's artwork, with UI elements kept unobtrusive.
*   **Immersive Experience:** The graphic novel panel will be prominently displayed.
*   **Clear Interaction:** Dialogue choices will be clearly presented and intuitive to interact with.

### 5. Content (Placeholder)

*   A small, self-contained interactive story will be created using placeholder images and the defined JSON data structure. This will demonstrate the core branching narrative functionality.
